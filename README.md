# Repo for all the settings

My personal bash/nvim setup.

# Download

You can use the scripts by just doing a git clone or use the setup.sh
which tries to will use git clone if available or wget to download the repo.

Currently the target folder is hard coded to be ~/src/settings

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielbisar/settings/main/bash/setup.sh
bash ./setup.sh
```
